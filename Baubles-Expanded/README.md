# Baubles Expanded

A fork of the 1.7.10 version of Azanor's Baubles mod with extra features. Backwards compatible with mods made using the original. Baubles Expanded adds the same four slots as the original out of the box, but can have up to twenty in total. Other mods can add entirely new slot types and allow a bauble to be placed in more than one type of slot.

Downloads are available from tags and on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/baubles-expanded).

# New Features

## For Users

- Override the slots assigned by default through the config.
- Set Soulbound enchantment IDs in the config so moded Soulbound enchantments function as expected. Works great with [Ars Magica](https://github.com/TCLProject/ArsMagica2-5)!
- Backwards compatibility with mods made for the original.

##  For Modders

- Register brand new slot types.
- Add slots to the inventory.
- Create baubles that can go in more than one slot type.

# Mods Using New Features

- [Et Futurum Requiem](https://github.com/Roadhog360/Et-Futurum-Requiem) (optional wing slot for the Elytra)

# Known Issues

- Due to a vanilla bug enchanted items can cause inventory slots and items to render incorrectly. This is fixed by [BugTorch](https://github.com/jss2a98aj/BugTorch).
- Replacing the original four slots or adding more slots of the those types may reduce backwards compatibility.
- The Bauble Case item from Botania cannot access more than the first four slots. This will be fixed in an upcoming fork of Botania.

## Special Thanks

- Azanor and contributors for creating and maintaining the original mod for as long as they did.
- TechnoParadox for creating the icon.
